## 1. Simple Storage

**Code:**\
https://github.com/flowdiary/BCD-101/blob/main/projects/AgeStorage.sol

**Description:**\
This Solidity smart contract demonstrates the fundamentals of Ethereum
storage, mappings, dynamic arrays, and structs.\
It includes basic operations such as:

-   Storing a number in contract storage\
-   Adding values to a dynamic array\
-   Creating and managing a list of people using a struct\
-   Mapping names to ages\
-   Retrieving stored values\
-   Removing the last element from an array

This project serves as an introductory foundation for understanding how
state variables and data structures work on the blockchain.
